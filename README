SNAQ-SEQ VSOFT SCRIPTS
Contact Tom Morrison

There are two forms of snaq-vsoft, the base version or a library prep specific version.  The base version
requires the user to create parameter files specific for their library prep.  The library prep specific versions
come with correct parameter files preinstalled (e.g., artic-1591-3.1 uses AccuGenomics product
No. 1591 with the ARTIC 3.1 library prep).  

Files copied into snaq-seq container:
basechange.sh - This converts a snaq parameter file NT-IS-CC.fasta into a lookup table. Run with script0d
CombineThreads.R - snaq multi threads various steps, this script combines SNAQ analysis and adds to SNAQ table
makeBams.sh - for troubleshooting various sorted remRecombo sam files are coverted into bam
makeFastq.awk - remRecombo output sam NT, this creates NT fastq
remRecombo.awk - parses aligned fastq files, removes IS and chr, counts various SNAQ QC values
snaq -main script that performs SNAQ analysis: fastq -> NT fastq + snaq results table. Run with script0c

Accessory scripts
fastq_lane_merging.sh -used to convert 4 lane data into 1 lane for SNAQ analysis
snaq-vsoft.sh -example script on how to feed a file with fasta paths into snaq-seq docker
makeBaseChange -example script on how to used snaq-seq docker to create base change file
buildDocker.sh & specific.df is used to build panel specific snaq-vsoft containers.
base.df is used to build the base snaq-vsoft using a command like docker build -t snaq-seq:v1.1 -f ./base.df
